# PLEASE READ!

## Important Notes
-Since the .ipynb file size is very large, you have to download it and open it in a Jupyter Notebook environment (Colab, JupyterLabs, etc.)
- In addition, the `mv_surface_temperatures_wide.parquet` and `mv_surface_temperatures_with_date_parts.parquet` do not need to downloaded and uploaded in the Notebook environment to be utilized. They will be accessed through Kaggle's API, and you WILL need to login using your Kaggle username and API-Key.
